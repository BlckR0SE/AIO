# Windows CMD Script

This project contains a Windows CMD script that provides a menu with several options for the user to choose from. The script is designed to be visually appealing with a red color theme.

## Options

The script currently includes the following options:

1. **IDM Activator**: This option runs a PowerShell script that activates IDM.
2. **Windows Activator**: This option runs two PowerShell scripts that activate Windows.
3. **Explorer Patcher**: Download the latest "Explorer Patcher"

## Usage

To use the script, simply run it in a Windows CMD environment. A menu will be displayed with the available options. Enter the number of the desired option to execute it.
